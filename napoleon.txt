The Napoleon Bonaparte

Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769, to Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, in his family's ancestral home Casa Buonaparte in Ajaccio, 
the capital of the island of Corsica. He was their fourth child and third son. This was a year after the island was transferred to France by the Republic 
of Genoa.[14] He was christened Napoleone di Buonaparte, probably named after an uncle (an older brother who did not survive infancy was the first of the 
sons to be called Napoleone). In his 20s, he adopted the more French-sounding Napoleon Bonaparte.[15][note 2]

The Corsican Buonapartes were descended from minor Italian nobility of Tuscan origin, who had come to Corsica from Liguria in the 16th century.[16][17]

His father Nobile Carlo Buonaparte was an attorney, and was named Corsica's representative to the court of Louis XVI in 1777. The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, Letizia Ramolino, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child.[18] Napoleon's maternal grandmother had married into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal Joseph Fesch, would fulfill a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years.

He had an elder brother, Joseph, and younger siblings: Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jerome. A boy and girl were born before Joseph but died in infancy. Napoleon was baptised as a Catholic.[19]
